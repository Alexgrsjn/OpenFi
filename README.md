2 build pegged Tokens To realword currencies,

3 bring fiat gateway so users can deposit Fiat money on an account and it mints the respective currency ideally 1:1 ratio but fees exist so maybe 1 : 0.99999 (user will be able to recieve sepa transfers in exchage for the pegged token to their bank account )
